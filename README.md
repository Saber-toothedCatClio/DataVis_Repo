Data Sources:

Fuel Consumption of Electricity Generating Facilities: 
https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/

Air Quality: 
https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual

Folder Structure:

Air Quality: This folder contains the air quality information from 2017-2023. I used only the Medain AQI and grouped them by state.

Fuel Consumption: This folder contains the general information, fuel consumption, and electricity generation of all the electricity generating facilities. I used only the fuel consumption measured in the form of heat by MMBtu and grouped them by state.

The Final_Project is a python notebook file containing the code for the visualizations. I created two seperate maps for fuel and air, and put them in a dashboard, then finally I combined them both into one graph.
